My name is Dao Minh Quan (Dao is my family name) from Vietnam. I obtained my bachelor degree in Mechatronics Engineering from Ho Chi Minh City University of Technology (HCMUT). As an undergraduate student, I got involved with the world of robotics by doing research on snake-like robots in BioMech Lab at HCMUT. During which, I studied the snake robots locomotion, especially the lateral undulation gait, and developed a heading controller to regulate the direction of this locomotion. 

After my graduation, I spent about 5 months working as a software engineer at Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Vietnam (RBVH), where I was a part of a team developing a MATLAB/Simulink-based simulation of Electronic Control Units of automobiles. 

Currently, I am doing my internship at Laboratoire des Sciences du Numérique de Nantes (LS2N) to fulfill the graduation requirements of my Master degree in Robotics. The objective of my internship is to help vehicles understand its dynamic surrounding environment whose essence lies in the detection and tracking of moving objects. To achieve this, I am attemping to combine learning-based object detectors in image space and evidential grid - an extension of occupancy grid which can explicitly represents movement independent with robot.
